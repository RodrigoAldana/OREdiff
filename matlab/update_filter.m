function ynew = update_filter(y, input, Delta, gamma)
%% update_filter - Filters a signal using a specified Lipschitz constant
% Inputs:
%    y     - Previous value of the output
%    input - Signal to be filtered
%    Delta - Time step
%    gamma - Lipschitz constant for the output
%
% Outputs:
%    ynew  - Filtered output signal
